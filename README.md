# Dynambu Frontend & API Server

I've decided to make my website, Dynambu, open-source, since I wasn't working on it either way, I thought it'd be a good idea to do it now. Feel free to browse around. Although, the code is pretty messy at the moment, and it'd be difficult to start your own Dynambu server due to scattered config, among other issues. Of course, you can, just don't forget to abide by the AGPL license!

# Setup instructions?

Config files are in /etc/. `lib.php` and `database.php` are probably your two main files for setup. Look for variables like $path and $datapath.
